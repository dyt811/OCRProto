FHIC is a type of chronic uveitis that is associated with long and fragile vessels that cross the
angle and insert high in the angle. Because of their high insertion, they are frequently (25% of
cases) nicked when entering the anterior chamber with a keratome, resulting in intra- or post-
operative hyphemas. This is why a more anteriorly-placed phaco wound is recommended in
these patients. "Amsler sign” is the term given for the bleeding that occurs secondary to nicking
these blood vessels.

Other key features of FHIC include:

* typically unilateral

* typically without severe pain or photophobia (unlike other forms of uveitis)

+ "stellate" (star-configuration) keratic precipitates (KP) that are evenly scattered across the
endothelium (in contrast to other forms of uveitis where the KP are located more inferiorly);
these KP are also small/medium-sized and white

+ iris heterochromia (involved blue eyes appear darker; involved brown eyes appear lighter)

+ lack of anterior or posterior synechiae

+ high incidence of posterior subcapsular cataract (75%)

* difficult to control glaucoma (i.e. if a FHIC eye has glaucoma, it usually requires surgical
glaucoma treatment for adequate control)

Lastly, unlike other forms of chronic iridocyclitis, it is not necessary to treat the inflammation in
FHIC. This is because the inflammation is not typically associated with the usual uveitic
complications (e.g. anterior/posterior synechiae, cystoid macular edema, severe eye
pain/photophobia, etc). Most of the management of FHIC focuses on glaucoma
screening/management and cataract removal.
