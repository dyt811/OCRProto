When you are performing cataract surgery, anterior chamber (AC) shallowing can make your
routine cataract surgery become much more difficult. AC shallowing can lead to radialization of
your capsulorhexis, more ultrasound energy being transmitted to the corneal endothelium, and
repeated iris prolapse through your main wound. The common causes of intraoperative AC
shallowing include:

+ inadequate infusion of balanced salt solution

+ leakage though an oversized incision (e.g. a >3.0 mm wound)

+ external pressure on the globe (e.g. improper speculum, too tight surgical drapes, tight
eyelids, too much retrobulbar anesthesia)

* positive vitreous (posterior) pressure

+ suprachoroidal hemorrhage

 

ive vitreous (posterior) pressure more commonly occurs in obese and thick-necked
patients, patients with breathing problems (e.g. COPD), and patients who are prone to Valsalva
maneuver (e.g. full bladders, constipated). Placing some of these patients in reverse
Trendelenburg can help relieve some of this positive pressure.
