3. PDEK - Pre-Descemet's endothelial keratoplasty was introduced as a means to transplant as
little stromal tissue as possible. In this technique, the big bubble technique that is used in DALK
is used to create a donor graft that consists of extreme posterior stroma (Dua's layer), DM and
endothelium. PDEK grafts are about ~30 microns. It is thought that this amount of minimal
stromal tissue allows for some ease of manipulation inside the eye and lower rates of
detachment. Very few corneal surgeons perform PDEK as both DSAEK and DMEK are relatively
easy to perform with proper patient selection.

4. DMEK - Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty is the logical conclusion for EK
procedures. In this surgery, the host DM/endothelium is replaced by a layer of donor
DM/endothelium (~10-15 microns) for a true 1:1 replacement of diseased tissue with healthy
tissue. DMEK is increasingly become the procedure of choice for EK for eyes that have 20/20
vision potential, such as Fuch's endothelial dystrophy. While DMEK may have slightly higher
risks for detachment and rebubbling, DMEK vision potential (both objective and subjective)
remains the highest among all existing corneal transplant procedures.

5. DSO/DWEK - Descemet's stripping only or Descemetorrhexis without endothelial
keratoplasty is a relatively new procedure that remains early in its experimental phase and
remains highly controversial. In this procedure, the central 4 mm of guttae are removed
(therefore only applicable to eyes with guttae in the central 4 mm of the visual axis) and no donor
corneal tissue is placed. The rationale is that surrounding endothelial cells will slide in from the
periphery after surgery and will eventually clear the cornea, which may take up to 3 months to
occur. Patients are concurrently placed on a Rho-kinase inhibitor (which is not FDA approved,
Rispasudil) to help prevent endothelial cell apoptosis and stimulate endothelial migration. Short-
term results appear to be promising, but long-term results remain to be seen. One problem
remains that even if the peripheral cells slide in, these cells have the same apoptotic genetic
defect that will lead to guttae/eventual cell death in the future.
