The vital dye fluorescein can be used to detect disruption of the surface epithelial intercellular
junctions; e.g. which occurs in corneal epithelial defects. It is a form of the water-soluble dye
hydroxyanthene.

Fluorescein is also used to measure "tear breakup time" (TBUT) and for applanation tonometry.
Rose Bengal and lissamine green stain devitalized cells or when a disruption occurs in the
overlying mucin coat. They are most commonly used to assess dry eye states. Rose Bengal is
much more irritating to the ocular surface as compared to either lissamine green or fluorescein.
