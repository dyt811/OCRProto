This patient likely is experiencing TASS (Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome). TASS is a sterile
inflammatory reaction generally secondary to contaminants injected into the eye or incorrect
pH of irrigating solutions.

TASS commonly occurs when remnants of cleaning detergents are not properly washed out of
reusable cannulas. In this question, the moxifloxacin was presumably injected with a reusable
cannula. Contamination of the Vigamox can also occur with dilution as noted in the answer
choice. Viscoelastics always come with a disposable cannula.

TASS presents in the acute post-operative period (i.e. 12-24 hours), typically earlier than acute
endophthalmitis (i.e. 2-7 days). Itis also generally confined to the anterior segment unlike
endophthalmitis which always involves the posterior segment.

Management of TASS includes: (1) excluding endophthalmitis as the cause of the inflammation;
(2) intensive topical corticosteroids; and (3) controlling intraocular pressure if it is elevated.
