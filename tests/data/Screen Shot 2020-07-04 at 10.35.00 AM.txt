Bietti crystalline corneoretinal dystrophy has tapetoretinal dystrophy, corneal crystals, and

nyctalopia. It is secondary to a defect in lipid metabolism. The crystals are deposited in the
peripheral cornea. Patients have retinal degeneration which leads to the nyctalopia.

The differential diagnosis for corneal crystals is the following: macular dystrophy
(mucopolysaccharide), granular dystrophy (hyaline), lattice dystrophy (amyloid), Bietti’s and
Schnyder’s dystrophies, ciloxan deposits, Strep Viridans causing infectious crystalline
keratopathy, cystinosis, multiple myeloma, and monoclonal gammopathy.
