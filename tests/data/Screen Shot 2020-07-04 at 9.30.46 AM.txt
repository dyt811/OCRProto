Placing the intraocular lens in the capsular bag is optimal even for pediatric patients.

A manual posterior capsulotomy can be performed in young children (e.g. 12-24 months old) to.
prevent the formation of thick posterior capsular opacities that may be ambylogenic. For older,
more cooperative children, the posterior capsule can be opened with a standard YAG laser.
Please note that higher energy levels are often needed since the pediatric posterior capsule is
oftentimes thicker than its adult counterpart.

Lastly, some surgeons elect to posteriorly prolapse the lens optic through the posterior
capsulotomy and leave the haptics in the capsular bag.
