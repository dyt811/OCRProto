Posterior Lamellar Procedures

1. DLEK - deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty. This is somewhat of a historical term as it may
be considered as the "grandfather" of EK procedures (early 2000's) (since it went on to father
DSAEK/DSAEK which fathered DMEK). In this procedure, a large amount of stromal tissue
(~200 microns) was used as a scaffold for donor DM/endothelial tissue

2. DSEK/DSAEK - Descemet's stripping (automated) endothelial keratoplasty was introduced in
the mid 2000's as a refinement of the DLEK procedure. With the advent of more precise ways of
cutting the donor cornea, lesser amounts of stromal tissue (100-150 microns) was needed as a
scaffold for donor DM/endothelial tissue. Both of these procedure are essentially the same;
however, in DSEK, the tissue is prepared by a manual dissection method, whereas in DSAEK, the
tissue prepared by an automated method that allows for more precise and reproducible desired
thickness of the donor tissue. Most donor grafts in the United States at the time of this writing
(March 2020) are prepared using the automated method, so it is more accurate to refer to these
procedures as DSAEK alone. However, because the term "DSEK" was used by many corneal
surgeons prior to the widespread popularity of DSAEK, many surgeons will use "DSEK"

 

nomenclature even though they are referring to DSAEK (confusing, yes!). As if this weren't
already complicated enough, recently terms such as "UT-DSAEK (ultrathin DSAEK)" and "nano-
thin DSAEK" have been introduced to refer to DSAEK grafts that are <100 microns and <50
microns, respectively. DSAEK remains an excellent choice for eyes that may not have 20/20
vision potential, for patients that may not be able to lay flat for along period of time, for patients
with other ocular pathologies (such as glaucoma tubes, post-vitrectomy, high myopia, aphakia)
that may make DMEK more challenging. DSAEK also has a lower detachment and rebubble rate
compared to DMEK, which may make it a preferred choice for patients who may not be able to
follow up closely. Vision potential with DSAEK, especially UT-DSAEK, is increasingly approaching
20/30-20/25. As a result, some surgeons are preferring UT-DSAEK or NT-DSAEK as their EK
procedure of choice.
