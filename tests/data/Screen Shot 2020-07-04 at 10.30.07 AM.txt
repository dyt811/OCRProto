The three major types of corneal transplantation techniques are the replacement of the anterior
cornea, the posterior cornea, or both. For trainees, learning about the different types of corneal
surgeries is a little bit like learning about alphabet soup! It may help to arrange them
anatomically to help keep the various procedures separate:

Anterior Lamellar Procedures

1. ALK/SALK - anterior lamellar keratoplasty or superficial anterior lamellar kertoplasty. This
procedure may be used for cases of anterior stromal scarring (eg, HSV scarring or recalcitrant
haze) wherein the depth of the opacity is not very deep (~200-300 microns). Anterior segment
OCT imaging may be used to measure the depth of the lesion so that as much healthy host
corneal tissue can be preserved using only a superficial trephination. Femtosecond laser may be
used to more accurately prepare the donor button and incise within the host for more accurate
replacement of diseased tissue with healthy tissue (FALK).

2. DALK - deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. This procedure is used for deep scarring that
includes the posterior stromal layers so long as the host DM/endothelial layers are healthy. For
example, DALK is an excellent option for keratoconus patients as the DM/endothelium in these
patients is usually healthy, and avoiding the transplantation of donor DM/endothelium may lead
to lower rejection rates.
