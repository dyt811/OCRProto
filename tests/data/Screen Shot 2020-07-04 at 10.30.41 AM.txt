Full Thickness Procedures

When all layers are transplanted, it is referred to as PKP or PK (penetrating keratoplasty). By far,
the most common indication for PKP is keratoconus followed by regraft (for failed PKP) and then
other forms of corneal scarring (HSV or ulcer scarring, etc.)

The percentage of all transplants that are PKPs has dramatically decreased from 95% in 2005 to
42% in 2014. In contrast, endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK and DMEK) percentages of all
transplants have increased from 3% in 2005 to 56% in 2014. In 2014, DSAEK represented
49.7% of all transplants and DMEK represented 6.2% of all transplants. However, the
percentage of DMEK transplants is rising as surgeons are becoming more comfortable with the
technique.

In 2014, anterior lamellar transplants (ALK, DALK, and FALK) represented about 2.0% of total
transplants.
