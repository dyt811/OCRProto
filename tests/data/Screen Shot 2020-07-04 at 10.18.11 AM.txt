This patient has an epibulbar dermoid. It may be associated with Goldenhar syndrome which
has dental and skeletal abnormalites, and preauricular skin tags. Vertebral abnormalities include

butterfly vertebrae; hemivertebrae, which produces secondary scoliosis; kyphosis; and rib
anomalies.

These lesions should not be excised as they can extend deep into the cornea. A shave biopsy or
superficial lamellar dissection may improve astigmatism. It most commonly occurs
inferotemporally (don't confuse this with dermoid cysts which most commonly occur
superotemporally). It generally induces plus cylinder astigmatism 90 degrees away and should
be corrected to reduce amblyopia.
